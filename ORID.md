Objective:
Today I learned about pair programming by practicing with my buddy, while exploring Spring Framework concepts and integration testing. 
The session covered essential Spring annotations and the fundamentals of writing integration tests for system components.

Reflective:
Today's lesson is really fun for me. The collaborative nature of pair programming made the learning process more engaging and helped me understand concepts better,
since we can share knowledge to each others. Integration testing initially seemed complex, but working through examples with a partner made it more approachable.
Also, as I haven't learned Spring Framework systematically, the session helped me understand the basics of Spring annotations and how they work together.

Interpretive:
I now see how pair programming naturally improves code quality through continuous review and knowledge sharing, it is really useful.
Integration testing, combined with Spring's testing support, ensures our system components work together correctly while maintaining code quality.

Decisional:
I will keep trying pair programming in the future and focus on writing integration tests before writing the implementation.
I'll also keep using TDD and continue studying Spring's testing framework features to improve our development process.
